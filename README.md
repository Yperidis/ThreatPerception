# Agent Danger Perception of Threats in Spatially Distributed Environments
The code of this repository was used for the work in [Time-critical decentralised situational awareness in emergencies: an adversarial biosecurity scenario](https://appliednetsci.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s41109-021-00402-6). Please reference the paper for mechanistic details.

### Dependencies
There are a few dependencies on the pure code, which was written in Python 3.8. For visualizations consider using matplotlib (needed for visualizing the examples in the Jupyter notebook).

* NumPy (checked with 1.18.5)
* NetworkX (checked with 2.4)
* SciPy (checked with 1.5.0)
